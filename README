Kernagic
========

Kernagic is a tool for spacing and kerning fonts. It provides a selection of methods that can be previewed and tuned interactively. 

To fit into a diverse set of workflows, Kernagic uses UFO fonts for input. UFO can act as a superset of other formats, and tools like [Fontforge](http://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/) can be used for converting to and from it.

Some methods relies on automatically detected stems, if the stem detection works poorly with your font, or you want to override spacing decisions, you can insert your own stems by clicking in the preview; stem overrides are saved in the UFO's private `lib.plist`.

If metrics are determined, they can be saved back into the UFO (shifting the x co-ordinates of all points in all glyphs to change the left bearings, and setting a new advance width to set the right bearings.)

For help about the commandline interface, `kernagic --help` provides further documentation.

Spacing Methods
===================

These are the various spacing methods implemented in Kernagic to date. The application is intended to be modular, so any programmer familiar with C and GTK+ can explore their own methods:

Inkbounds
--------------

A simple fallback spacing method.

This calculates an even 'grey value' between each letter pair. 

Currently this only produces kerning, not metrics.

Renaissance Cadence Table
-------------------------

A predefined spacing table method. 

This table encodes knowledge of glyph morphologies, found in Frank Blokland's excellent [Letter Model](http://lettermodel.org). 

It assumes your typeface is a traditional renaissance design, with classic glyph proportions, and automatically prepares a fitting.

Currently this only produces metrics, not kerning.

Gap Cadence Discovery
-------------------------

`left bearing = gap * (offset + 0.5) - left stem width`

The gap method allows specifying the gap to use between stems in neighbouring glyphs. (The resulting advance is snapped to a multiple of the gap.)

Currently this only produces metrics, not kerning.

Usage
=====================

A video on how to use the program is at: TODO

Running `kernagic --ipsumat` is a way to run the ipsum generator stand-alone as a commandline utility. Run `kernagic --ipsumat --help` for more information.

Debugging
-----------

A shell script, `kernagic-debug.sh`, is included that allows you to produce backtraces conveniently.
